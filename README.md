# ear_classify
A repository with my solution to the 3. assignment of Image Based Biometry course

Because uploading images to github is a bad practice, I have decided to upload only the code that classifies the test images using the CNN classifier.

**IMPORTANT WHEN DOWNLOADING THE CODE:**

The folders **test** and **train** should contain images from the AWE dataset as stated in **awe-translation.csv**. the folder **awe** should contain all all the images from the awe dataset in subfolders "001", "002", etc.

I ran all tests on my 64-bit Windows 10 laptop using a conda environment created specifically for this assignment. The environment should be recreateable with the **sb3.yml** file.


For any additional questions, feel free to contact me using the e-mail **jn2279@student.uni-lj.si**. Thank you.
